# Retail Store Sales Analysis – SQL Project

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on **Retail Store Sales Analysis** using **SQL**, applying **EDA and data cleaning techniques directly within SQL** to extract meaningful business insights from transactional retail data.

The analysis answers key business questions related to **sales performance, customer purchasing behavior, product trends, and time-based patterns**, demonstrating how SQL can be used end-to-end for analytics without relying on BI tools.

---

## 🎯 Goals of the Project

* Perform **EDA-style analysis using SQL** on retail sales data
* Clean and standardize raw transactional data
* Analyze sales trends by product, customer, and time
* Identify high-performing and underperforming categories
* Generate insights suitable for reporting and decision-making

---

## 🗂️ Project Files

* **retail sales analysis.sql** – SQL queries used for analysis
* **Retail Store Sales Data.csv** – Source retail transaction dataset

---

## 🧾 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains retail transaction-level information, including:

* Order / Transaction ID
* Order Date
* Product Category and Sub-Category
* Quantity Sold
* Sales Amount
* Customer / Store attributes

This dataset resembles real-world retail data with **multiple categorical dimensions and time-based measures**.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & EDA Skills (SQL-Based)

The project applies **data cleaning and exploratory analysis directly in SQL**, including:

* Handling missing or null values using `WHERE`, `CASE`, and `COALESCE`
* Standardizing categorical values (categories, sub-categories)
* Filtering invalid or zero-value transactions
* Exploring distributions using `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`
* Identifying sales outliers and unusual purchasing patterns

These steps ensure the data is **analysis-ready** before deeper insights are derived.

## 🧭 Analysis Steps / Methodology

1. **Data Understanding**
   Reviewed schema, column meanings, and data quality issues.

2. **Data Cleaning (SQL)**
   Cleaned and standardized retail data using SQL transformations.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   Explored sales distributions, category contribution, and customer behavior.

4. **Analytical Querying**
   Used aggregations, grouping, filtering, and conditional logic to answer business questions.

5. **Insight Interpretation**
   Converted query outputs into actionable retail insights.
